\section{Summary}
I'm studying computer engineering. I have experience working with big data tools, developing server-side and data-intensive applications, data pipelines, and real-time processing applications.
I like learning more about software architecture, design patterns, test-driven development, and cutting-edge technologies.
I'm in love with new challenges!

\section{Work Experience}

\cventry{May 2021--current}{Software Engineer}{Tapsell}{Tehran, Iran}{}{%
Tapsell is the most significant ad service with 40M users in Iran. My responsibility was to create and maintain services for storing and retrieving and also real-time updating users' information. 
Out stack is kotlin and spring-boot. We use Kafka for connecting our microservices, Cassandra and Elasticsearch, and MongoDB for storing data. 
We also use Druid as a real-time analytics database for aggregated queries. 
as a software engineer, I did my best to develop real-time processing applications. designing efficient and simple software architecture, writing unit and integration tests and communicating with other teams such as AI team and giving them test and train data to train their models were some of my important responsibilities. }

\cventry{Apr 2020--May 2021}{Android Developer}{Mahsan}{Tehran, Iran}{}{%
  \begin{itemize}
    \item VPN Client:
I designed and implemented a vpn client android application to connect to organization's server. The most challenging parts of this project was reducing battery usage for long-time connections.
    \item Messenger:
I designed and implemented a messenger android application from scratch. We had an XMPP server and the messenger application had to communicate with it. Writing unit and integration tests and using reactive programming for getting better performance were some of the key parts of that project.
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Nov 2017--Apr 2020}{Android Developer}{Oddrun}{Tehran, Iran}{}{%
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Telfa project:
it was an unofficial telegram.
our task was adding new features to telegram. some challenges of this project were maintaining the application and having a secure connection with the server.
    \item Resana project:
resana is an advertising platform that my task was developing its Android SDK. smart communication to the server to optimize battery and data usage, as well as low SDK volume, have been key parts of the project. One of the skills acquired in this project was marketing to attract different applications for collaboration.
    \item Befrest project:
befrest is a push service that I have been responsible for developing its android SDK. the main goal of this project was to create a secure and stable web socket connection to the server to receive messages in-app and when app is in the background. writing tests for different parts of the project and using TDD procedure and CI-CD have been key parts of the project.
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Jun 2017--Oct 2017}{Internship}{Sarashpazpapion}{Tehran, Iran}{}{%
An Android app to show recipes. Food Network Social Network. Most of the focus of this project has been on the user-friendly interface
}
