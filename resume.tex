\section{Summary}
I study computer engineering. I have experience working with big data tools, developing server-side and data-intensive applications, data pipelines, and real-time processing applications.
I like learning more about software architecture, design patterns, test-driven development, and cutting-edge technologies.
I'm in love with new challenges!

\section{Work Experience}

\cventry{2021--current}{Software Engineer}{Tapsell}{Tehran, Iran}{}{%
Tapsell is the biggest ad service with 40M users in Iran. as a software engineer, I did my best to develop real-time processing applications. designing efficient and simple software architecture and also communicating with other teams were some of my important responsibilities.}

\cventry{Apr 2020--May 2021}{Android Developer}{Mahsan}{Tehran, Iran}{}{%
  Moka application.
Moka is a project that tries to manage android devices. it is mostly used by people of an organization that the manager wants to restrict their access to critical data. with this application, the manager can enable or disable data usage, GPS, Bluetooth, and other device features from a remote server.
My role was developing this android application with other team members. our architecture was Clean and MVVM.
I also have worked on different applications besides Moka like a VPN client and a messenger.

\cventry{Nov 2017--Apr 2020}{Android Developer}{Oddrun}{Tehran, Iran}{}{%
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Telfa project was an unofficial telegram.
our task was adding new features to telegram. some challenges of this project were maintaining the application and having a secure connection with the server.
    \item Resana project.
resana is an advertising platform that my task was developing its Android SDK. smart communication to the server to optimize battery and data usage, as well as low SDK volume, have been key parts of the project. One of the skills acquired in this project was marketing to attract different applications for collaboration.
    \item Befrest project.
befrest is a push service that I have been responsible for developing its android SDK. the main goal of this project was to create a secure and stable web socket connection to the server to receive messages in-app and when app is in the background. wirting tests for different parts of the project and using TDD procedure and CI-CD have been key parts of the project.
  \end{itemize}
